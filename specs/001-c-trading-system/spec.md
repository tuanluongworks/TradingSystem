# Feature Specification: C++ Trading System

**Feature Branch**: `001-c-trading-system`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "# C++ Trading System Specification

## Overview
Build a desktop application for manual trading. It will feature a simple, real-time UI connected to a high-performance C++ backend that manages market data, order execution, and position tracking.

## User Stories

### UI/Frontend
- **US-1: Market Data View:** As a trader, I want to see real-time price ticks (symbol, bid, ask, last price) for a list of subscribed instruments in a simple table so I can monitor the market.
- **US-2: Order Entry Panel:** As a trader, I want a simple form to place BUY and SELL orders (Market and Limit) for a specific instrument and quantity.
- **US-3: Position and Order View:** As a trader, I want to see my current open positions, working orders, and a history of executed trades in separate tabs or tables.

### Backend/Core Logic
- **US-4: Market Data Connection:** As the system, I need to connect to a financial data provider via a WebSocket feed to receive real-time market data. For initial development, this can be a simulated data feed.
- **US-5: Order Execution Engine:** As the system, I need to manage the lifecycle of an order (New, Accepted, Filled, Canceled). For initial development, this can be a simple in-memory order matching simulator.
- **US-6: Risk Management:** As the system, I must perform pre-trade risk checks, such as rejecting orders that would exceed a defined position limit for a given instrument.
- **US-7: Persistence:** As the system, I need to log all executed trades to a simple local database (e.g., SQLite) for persistence."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: What are the specific position limits that risk management should enforce? ‚Üí A: Quantity/shares per instrument
- Q: How should the system handle partial order fills? ‚Üí A: Automatically accept partial fills and leave remainder working
- Q: Is this a single-user or multi-user trading system? ‚Üí A: Single-user desktop application (no authentication needed)
- Q: What should happen when market data connection is lost? ‚Üí A: Disable trading, show status, reconnect
- Q: What should happen when the database is unavailable for trade logging? ‚Üí A: Log to file, then sync

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A trader opens the trading application to monitor market movements and execute trades. They view real-time price data for their watched instruments, analyze market conditions, enter buy or sell orders, and monitor their positions and order status throughout the trading session.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is running and connected to market data, **When** the trader views the market data panel, **Then** they see real-time price updates (symbol, bid, ask, last price) for all subscribed instruments
2. **Given** the trader wants to place an order, **When** they fill out the order entry form with instrument, side (buy/sell), order type (market/limit), and quantity, **Then** the system accepts the order and updates the working orders view
3. **Given** an order is placed and market conditions allow execution, **When** the order matching occurs, **Then** the order status updates to filled and appears in the trade history
4. **Given** a trader attempts to place an order, **When** the order would exceed position limits, **Then** the system rejects the order with an appropriate risk message
5. **Given** the trader is monitoring their portfolio, **When** they view the positions panel, **Then** they see current open positions with profit/loss calculations

### Edge Cases
- When market data connection is lost: system disables order entry, shows connection status, and automatically attempts reconnection
- When partial order fills occur: system automatically accepts partial fills and keeps remaining quantity as working order
- When database is unavailable: system logs trades to backup file and syncs when database connection is restored
- What happens when the trader attempts to place an order with invalid parameters (negative quantity, unknown instrument)?
- How does the system behave when position limits are reached?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display real-time market data including symbol, bid price, ask price, and last traded price for subscribed instruments
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow traders to place buy and sell orders with specified instrument, quantity, and order type (market or limit)
- **FR-003**: System MUST track and display current open positions showing instrument, quantity, average price, and current profit/loss
- **FR-004**: System MUST show working orders with their current status (new, accepted, partially filled) and remaining quantity
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain a history of executed trades showing timestamp, instrument, side, quantity, and price
- **FR-006**: System MUST perform pre-trade risk validation including position limit checks before accepting orders
- **FR-007**: System MUST reject orders that would cause position limits to be exceeded
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist all executed trades to local storage for audit and recovery purposes
- **FR-009**: System MUST support order lifecycle management with states: new, accepted, filled, canceled
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow traders to cancel working orders that have not yet been filled

- **FR-012**: System MUST enforce position limits based on maximum quantity/shares per instrument
- **FR-013**: System MUST automatically accept partial order fills and keep the remaining quantity working as an active order
- **FR-014**: System MUST disable order entry when market data connection is lost, display connection status, and automatically attempt to reconnect

- **Position**: Current holding in an instrument showing net quantity and average price
- **Trade**: Executed transaction record showing all order fulfillment details
- **Market Data**: Real-time price information including bid, ask, and last traded price for instruments
- **Risk Limits**: Position constraints that govern maximum allowable quantity/shares per instrument
