# Research Document: C++ Trading System

**Date**: 2025-09-27
**Feature**: C++ Trading System
**Scope**: Technical decisions and best practices research

## Technology Stack Decisions

### UI Framework: Dear ImGui + OpenGL
**Decision**: Dear ImGui with OpenGL backend for cross-platform desktop UI
**Rationale**:
- Immediate mode GUI perfect for real-time data visualization
- Low overhead suitable for high-frequency trading applications
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Excellent performance for financial dashboards
- Simple integration with C++ backends
**Alternatives considered**:
- Qt: Heavier framework, more complex licensing
- Native platform UIs: Would require separate implementations
- Web-based (Electron): Higher memory overhead, latency concerns

### WebSocket Library: Boost.Beast
**Decision**: Boost.Beast for WebSocket market data connections
**Rationale**:
- Part of Boost ecosystem, well-tested and maintained
- High-performance async I/O suitable for trading systems
- Header-only library with minimal dependencies
- Excellent C++20 coroutine support
- Industry standard for C++ network programming
**Alternatives considered**:
- WebSocket++: Less maintained, performance concerns
- Custom implementation: Development time and reliability risks
- curl WebSocket: Limited async capabilities

### Database: SQLite3 + sqlite_orm
**Decision**: SQLite3 with sqlite_orm C++ wrapper for trade persistence
**Rationale**:
- Embedded database requiring no server setup
- ACID compliance for trade integrity
- sqlite_orm provides modern C++ interface with compile-time safety
- Perfect for single-user desktop application
- Excellent performance for trading volumes
**Alternatives considered**:
- PostgreSQL: Overkill for single-user application
- File-based logging: No ACID guarantees, complex querying
- In-memory only: Data loss risk

### Testing Framework: GoogleTest
**Decision**: GoogleTest for comprehensive unit and integration testing
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard C++ testing framework
- Excellent mocking capabilities with GoogleMock
- Thread-safe testing suitable for concurrent code
- Rich assertion library for financial calculations
- CI/CD integration support
**Alternatives considered**:
- Catch2: Less feature-rich for complex financial testing
- Custom framework: Development overhead

### Build System: CMake
**Decision**: CMake as primary build system with vcpkg for dependencies
**Rationale**:
- Cross-platform build generation
- Excellent third-party library integration
- vcpkg provides reliable C++ package management
- Industry standard for C++ projects
- Good IDE integration
**Alternatives considered**:
- Bazel: Overkill for single application
- Make: Platform-specific, lacks dependency management
- Conan: Less mature ecosystem than vcpkg

## Architecture Patterns

### Message Queue Pattern for Inter-Layer Communication
**Decision**: Thread-safe message queues using std::queue with std::mutex and std::condition_variable
**Rationale**:
- Enables true asynchronous processing between UI, core, and infrastructure layers
- Prevents blocking operations from affecting UI responsiveness
- Natural backpressure handling for high-frequency data
- Testable in isolation
**Implementation**: Custom MessageQueue<T> template class with RAII locking

### Order Management State Machine
**Decision**: Explicit state machine for order lifecycle management
**Rationale**:
- Clear state transitions (New → Accepted → Filled/Canceled)
- Thread-safe state management
- Audit trail for regulatory compliance
- Predictable behavior under concurrent access
**States**: NEW, ACCEPTED, PARTIALLY_FILLED, FILLED, CANCELED, REJECTED

### Risk Management Interceptor Pattern
**Decision**: Interceptor pattern for pre-trade risk validation
**Rationale**:
- Configurable risk rules without core logic changes
- Chain of responsibility for multiple risk checks
- Easy testing of individual risk components
- Performance-critical path optimization
**Checks**: Position limits, order size validation, instrument validation

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management Strategy
**Decision**: Smart pointers (std::shared_ptr, std::unique_ptr) with custom allocators for high-frequency objects
**Rationale**:
- RAII for exception safety in trading code
- Reduced memory fragmentation
- Thread-safe reference counting
- Custom allocators for order/trade objects to minimize allocation overhead

### Concurrency Model
**Decision**: Producer-consumer pattern with dedicated threads per major component
**Rationale**:
- Market data thread: WebSocket processing
- Engine thread: Order matching and execution
- UI thread: Rendering and user interaction
- Persistence thread: Database operations
- Clear separation prevents thread contention

### Data Structures for Order Book
**Decision**: std::map for price levels with std::deque for order queues
**Rationale**:
- O(log n) price level lookup suitable for typical market depth
- FIFO order execution within price levels
- Memory-efficient for sparse order books
- Standard library reliability

## Integration Patterns

### Market Data Processing Pipeline
**Decision**: Streaming JSON parser with message batching
**Rationale**:
- Minimal latency for price updates
- Batch processing reduces UI update frequency
- JSON schema validation for data integrity
- Backpressure handling for burst scenarios

### Database Persistence Strategy
**Decision**: Asynchronous write-through with synchronous backup logging
**Rationale**:
- Immediate file logging for disaster recovery
- Asynchronous database writes for performance
- Batch commits for throughput optimization
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities

## Error Handling Strategy

### Exception Safety Guarantee
**Decision**: Strong exception safety for all trading operations
**Rationale**:
- No partial state corruption in financial calculations
- RAII ensures resource cleanup
- Clear error propagation to UI layer
- Audit trail for all error conditions

### Network Failure Recovery
**Decision**: Exponential backoff with circuit breaker pattern
**Rationale**:
- Graceful degradation during network issues
- Automatic reconnection without user intervention
- Prevents cascade failures
- Status reporting to UI layer

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
**Decision**: Strict validation at API boundaries with whitelisting
**Rationale**:
- Prevent injection attacks on order parameters
- Validate all numeric inputs for range and precision
- Symbol validation against known instruments
- Rate limiting for order submission

### Data Protection
**Decision**: Local encryption for sensitive configuration
**Rationale**:
- No network transmission of credentials
- Local file encryption for API keys
- Secure memory clearing for sensitive data
- Audit logging for security events

## Summary

All technical decisions align with constitutional requirements for performance, reliability, modularity, testing excellence, and code quality. The chosen stack provides a solid foundation for a high-performance trading system while maintaining development efficiency and code maintainability.
