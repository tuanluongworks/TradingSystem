# C++ Trading System Core Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Performance First
The system MUST be optimized for low latency and high throughput. Every design decision prioritizes efficient algorithms, minimal memory allocations, and leverages modern C++ features for performance. Performance degradation is unacceptable and requires immediate remediation.

**Rationale**: Trading systems operate in microsecond environments where performance directly impacts profitability and competitive advantage.

### II. Robustness and Reliability
The backend MUST be stable, handle exceptions gracefully, and maintain data integrity. Code MUST be resilient to network failures and unexpected inputs. System failures that result in data corruption or unavailability are non-negotiable violations.

**Rationale**: Financial systems require absolute reliability as failures can result in significant financial losses and regulatory violations.

### III. Modularity and Separation of Concerns
The system architecture MUST clearly separate the UI, core trading logic, and backend services (data connection, execution). Each module MUST have clearly defined interfaces and responsibilities with minimal coupling between components.

**Rationale**: Clear separation enables independent testing, maintenance, and evolution of system components while reducing complexity and risk.

### IV. Testing Excellence (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Unit tests are MANDATORY for all backend logic. Testing MUST use GoogleTest framework. Test-driven development practices MUST be followed with comprehensive test coverage for all critical trading logic and risk management functions.

**Rationale**: Financial systems require exhaustive testing to ensure correctness and prevent costly errors in production trading environments.

### V. Code Quality and Standards
All code MUST adhere to the Google C++ Style Guide. Code MUST be written in C++20 standard. Smart pointers MUST be used over raw pointers in concurrent code. Code quality violations require immediate correction before code review approval.

**Rationale**: Consistent code standards ensure maintainability, reduce bugs, and enable team collaboration on complex financial algorithms.

## Development Standards

**Language Standard**: C++20 for all new code
**Build System**: CMake as the primary build system
**Dependency Management**: vcpkg or Conan for external libraries
**Concurrency**: C++ standard library (`std::thread`, `std::mutex`, `std::atomic`) only
**Testing Framework**: GoogleTest for all unit tests
**Code Style**: Google C++ Style Guide compliance mandatory
**UI Technology**: Dear ImGui or minimal Qt Quick for lightweight, cross-platform interfaces

## Quality Gates

**Pre-commit Requirements**:
- All unit tests MUST pass
- Code MUST compile without warnings
- Code style checks MUST pass
- Performance regression tests MUST pass

**Code Review Requirements**:
- All trading logic changes require two technical reviews
- Risk management code requires additional compliance review
- Performance-critical paths require benchmark validation

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and coding standards. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles.

**Amendment Process**: Constitution changes require team consensus and must include impact analysis on existing codebase. All amendments must maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly justified.

**Compliance Review**: Weekly architecture reviews ensure ongoing adherence to principles. Violations must be documented with remediation plans and timelines.

**Complexity Justification**: Any deviation from these principles requires explicit documentation of why simpler alternatives are insufficient and approval from technical leadership.
